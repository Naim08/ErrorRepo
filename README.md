# ErrorRepo

The error `name 'uvicorn' is not defined` suggests that the uvicorn server, which is used to run FastAPI applications, is not being recognized. This could be due to it not being installed or not being imported correctly in your code. However, from the provided code snippets, there is no direct usage of 'uvicorn' in the code, it's only mentioned in a comment. 

The comment suggests that you should run the app with `uvicorn app:app --reload`. If you're running this command in your terminal and getting the error, it's likely that uvicorn is not installed in your environment.

To fix this, you need to install uvicorn. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

If uvicorn is supposed to be used in the code, you would need to import it at the top of your file:

```python
from uvicorn import run
```

And then use it to run your application:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
```

Please replace "app:app" with the actual application instance in your code. The host and port can be adjusted to your needs. The `reload=True` argument enables hot reloading, which means the server will automatically update whenever you make changes to your code.
